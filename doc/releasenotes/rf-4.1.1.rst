support.

Questions and comments related to the release can be sent to the
`robotframework-users`_ mailing list or to `Robot Framework Slack`_,
and possible bugs submitted to the `issue tracker`_.

If you have pip_ installed, just run

::

   pip install --upgrade robotframework

Most important enhancements
===========================

Python 3.10 support
-------------------

Robot Framework 4.1.1 adds official support for the forthcoming `Python 3.10`_
release. Also older Robot Framework releases work with Python 3.10, but there
are warnings due to those versions using nowadays deprecated Python APIs.

In addition to supporting Python 3.10 in general, Robot Framework 4.1.1 adds
support for writing unions in type hints like `arg: X | Y`. (`#4075`_, `PEP 604`__).
As the example below demonstrates, this syntax is quite a bit more convenient
in cases where an argument has multiple possible types:

.. code:: python

    # Old way, need to import and use Union.

    from typing import Union


    def example(arg: Union[int, float]):
        ...

.. code:: python

    # New way, no imports needed. Requires Python 3.10 and RF 4.1.1 or newer.

    def example(arg: int | float):
        ...

Fixes to rare crashes
---------------------

Robot Framework 4.1.1 fixes several problems resulting to fatal crashes during
execution. Crashes are always severe, but luckily all these crashes occurred
only in rather rare circumstances:

- SKIP in combination with continuable failures containing HTML error messages (`#4062`_)
- Non-existing variable used as teardown (`#4061`_)
- Strange functions without `__annotations__` (`#4059`_)
- `--removekeywords WUKS` when listener has logged messages and `Wait Until Keyword
  Succeeds` keyword itself is otherwise empty (`#4063`_)

Acknowledgements
================

Robot Framework 4.1.1 development has been sponsored by the `Robot Framework Foundation`_
and its `close to 50 member organizations <https://robotframework.org/foundation/#members>`_.
Big thanks for the foundation for its continued support! If your organization is using
Robot Framework and finds it useful, consider joining the foundation to make make
sure it is maintained and developed further also in the future.

Robot Framework 4.1.1 was a pretty small release and there was only one pull request
by the wider open source community. Thanks `@chriscallan <https://github.com/chriscallan>`__
for enhancing documentation related to `Set Test Variable` (`#3952`_) and also to everyone
else who has submitted bug reports, helped debugging problems, or otherwise helped with
this release.
